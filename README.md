# SlicedMaps

This repo contains codes corresponding to the numerical experiments from the paper *``Convergence Rates for Distribution Matching with Sliced Optimal Transport''*.

The Iterative Distribution Transfer algorithm is implemented with decreasing learning rates, a variant that we refer to as the slice-matching scheme. 
Numerical experiments study its convergence behavior under various settings.
