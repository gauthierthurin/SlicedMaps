# SlicedMaps

This repo contains codes corresponding to the numerical experiments from the paper *``Convergence Rates for Distribution Matching with Sliced Optimal Transport''*.

The .py file contains the main functions, for ease of reproduction, and the notebook runs the experiments. 

The Iterative Distribution Transfer algorithm is implemented with decreasing learning rates, a variant that we refer to as the slice-matching scheme. 
Numerical experiments study its convergence behavior under various settings.
